AirBnB Clone Project
Welcome to the AirBnB Clone project! This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and involves creating a basic clone of the AirBnB web application. The project is divided into several phases, starting with the command interpreter that serves as the foundation for managing various aspects of the application.

Description of the Project
The AirBnB Clone project aims to replicate the basic functionality of the AirBnB platform. The initial phase focuses on developing a command interpreter that allows users to create, manage, and manipulate data related to users, places, states, cities, amenities, and reviews.

Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a shell-like application that allows users to interact with the underlying storage engine. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for creating, updating, destroying, and retrieving objects.
